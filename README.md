# WarmupReps iOS

This application is a warmup sets and reps calculator for the starting
strength training program.  You choose your working weight for each
exercise in the program and the warmup sets and reps are automatically
calculated, along with the weights you need to place on the bar.  As
you use it, it remembers preferences such as bar size, unit system,
and the weights for each exercise when you come back for the next
workout.

It is a fork of the H5 app [WarmupReps](https://github.com/nmunson/warmup-reps)
by [nmunson](https://github.com/nmunson).
